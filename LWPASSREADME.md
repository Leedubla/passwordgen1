This project is of a Random Password Generator.
It allows the user to dictate their criteria for their password all within a few clicks of a button. They get the choice of how many characters will appear. They also get to choose if the want capitalized letter, numbers, or any special characters. This is a great way to update your password regularly without the fear of making it something you have already used before, and it makes it unique.
